## Applied Bayesian Inference
A variational autoencoder consists of two parts: an encoder and a decoder. The encoder is given x and calculates the probability of z, expressed as a two-dimensional sample from a gaussian distribution. In other words, it uses bayesian inference to approximate P(z|x). The decoder does the opposite, approximating the bernoulli distribution x which would be the input digit: P(x|z).
